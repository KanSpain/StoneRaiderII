*Stone Raider II* is a game released for the Dragon microcomputer.  It was licensed to Microdeal and sold for a period of time from 1986.  The game is heavily inspired by *Boulder Dash*, which I played on the C64 at the time and wanted something similar for the Dragon.  The objective of the game is to guide your man to the exit in a series of caves, collecting diamonds along the way.  Diamonds must also be collected to open the exit from each cave.  Watch out for the many hazards that can kill your man.  There are falling boulders and monsters than can mean instant death.  It is also possible to be trapped behind a rock slide or the dreaded slime without any way of getting out before the timer runs out.

There is a total of 25 caves in the game.  Each cave requires a different approach to escape.  Some caves are relatively straight forward, while others require significantly more planning and coordinated movement.

Only joystick control is supported.

See the [Stone Raider II page](http://www.rolfmichelsen.com/stoneraider.html) for more information, including binary downloads that can be used on a real Dragon computer or in one of the many emulators that exist.


Content of the repository
-------------------------

The repository contains the following files and directories.

<table>
<tr><td>Original</td><td>Original source code exactly as copied from my Dragon diskettes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>StoneRaiderII.txt</td><td>Complete source code in one file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>License.txt</td><td>Licensing conditions.</td></tr>
</table>

Note that the source code is complete except that the cave data is missing.  Also, this source code is not for the version that was actually released and distributed by Microdeal.  The orignal name of the game was *Dig-It*, but Microdeal requested that the name be changed to *Stone Raider II* when licensing the game to be able to re-use artwork for another game and shorten the time to market.  This version is using the original name.  The source code for the Microdeal version has been lost, but who knows, maybe it will be recovered some day...
